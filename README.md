This is my implementation of a Spreadsheet application for my Object-Oriented Programming Principles class I took! 
The program was designed in mind with GRASP Design principles, with features being implemented every week over 8 weeks.
The program is made using an MVVM design, so the functionality and logic of each cell is separated from the Graphic application
Features include:
- Expression parsing so cells can call upon each other
- XML file support for seamless saving and loading of data
- Customizable cell background colors
-  Undo/Redo functionality for changing Cells' background color, text color, and text

You can see the functionality included within the HW branches from Week 4 - Week 10 (Week 1 - 3 were about tasks to get used to working with C# and the MVVM pattern from which this would be made with).
